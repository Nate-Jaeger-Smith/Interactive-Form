# Interactive Form

This project implements various functionalities using JavaScript.

## Description

The JavaScript file handles form validation, event handling, and DOM manipulation for a fictional web developer conference. It includes event listeners for form submission, input validation, and dynamic display of elements based on user selections.

## Real-Time Error Messaging

The credit card input will validate user input after every keyup event. Error styling will update once card requirements are met.

## Conditional Error Message

Email input will display different error messages depending on email formatting. Error styling happens on keyup event.
    - If email is deleted, message "Email field cannot be left blank" will appear
    - If email doesn't contain a "@" and "." symbol, message "Email must contain a '@' and '.' character" will appear
